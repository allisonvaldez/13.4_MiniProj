Mini Project 32

Please read the README.pdf file. It explains (with evidence) why I could not use the playcode website for the project. 

For each question I included:
1. a seperate .js file (area.js for Question 1 and round.js for Question 2).
2. the screenshots of the output that I received for each question (as Question1Screenshot.png and Question2Screenshot.png).
