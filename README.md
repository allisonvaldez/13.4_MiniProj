Mini Project 32

Please read the README.pdf file. It explains (with evidence) why I could not use the playcode website for the project. For each assignment included a seperate .js file for each question, and the screenshots of the output that I received for each question (as Question1Screenshot.png and Question2Screenshot.png).
